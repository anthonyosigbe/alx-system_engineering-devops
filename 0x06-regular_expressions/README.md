<h1>Regular expression</h1>
<h2>Regex DevOps</h2>

<p>Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the world of regular expressions and honed my skills in constructing them. The practical experience involved creating and fine-tuning regular expressions using Ruby's powerful Oniguruma library, a versatile tool for pattern matching and text manipulation. <br>This hands-on exercise not only deepened my understanding of regular expressions but also provided a practical foundation for harnessing their capabilities in real-world applications.</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
<ol>
<li>0. Simply matching School: Ruby script that matches the regular expression <b>School</b></li>
<li><1. Repetition Token #0: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hbn with between 2-5 t's in between hb and n. </li>
<li>2. Repetition Token #1: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hn with 0 or 1 occurrences of b and 0 or 1 occurrences of t in between h and n.</li>
<li>3. Repetition Token #2: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hbn with 1 or more t's in between hb and n.</li>
<li>4. Repetition Token #3: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hbn with 0 or more t's in between hb and n.</li>
<li>5. Not quite HBTN yet: Ruby script that matches a regular expression starting with h and ending with n with any single character in between.</li>
