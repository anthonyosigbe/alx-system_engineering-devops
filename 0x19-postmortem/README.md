# Incident Report Guide: Crafting a Postmortem

This guide outlines the process of creating an Incident Report, commonly known as a Postmortem, following practices similar to those used by Google engineers. A comprehensive Postmortem consists of five key sections: Issue Summary, Timeline, Root Cause, Resolution and Recovery, and Corrective and Preventive Measures. Below, we delve into each section to understand its significance and content.

## Issue Summary

- Provide a concise summary (limited to 5 sentences).
- Mention the duration of the incident, including start and end times, with the timezone specified.
- Describe the impact, noting the extent to which user requests resulted in 500 errors, highlighting if it reached 100% at any point.
- Conclude with the identified root cause of the issue.

## Timeline

- Specify the timezone for all times mentioned.
- Detail the duration of the outage, starting from when it began to when it was fully resolved.
- Note the time when staff were alerted to the issue.
- Document the sequence of actions and events that took place to address the outage.
- Indicate the time when normal service was restored.

## Root Cause

- Provide a thorough explanation of the events leading to the incident.
- Aim for transparency and avoid minimizing the issue.

## Resolution and Recovery

- Offer a detailed account of the steps taken to resolve the issue, including specific times.
- Highlight any immediate actions that contributed to the recovery of the service.

## Corrective and Preventive Measures

- List actionable steps and strategies to prevent the recurrence of such an incident.
- Reflect on the incident to identify improvements for future response efforts.

This structure aims to ensure a clear, comprehensive, and actionable report that not only addresses the immediate issue but also contributes to the ongoing improvement of incident management processes.
